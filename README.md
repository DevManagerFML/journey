# The Journey
I want to document the process for creating an alternate online personality.  The goal is to start a blog and social media posts about becoming a manager. 

Step 1: Create twitter account

Step 2: Find profile image.  Used pixabay to find picture of tired guy.

Step 3: Update image in PhotoShop with all the logos of Tech Stack we use

Step 4: Make first post

Step 5: Create a place to start documenting all this stuff (here wea re in Git)
